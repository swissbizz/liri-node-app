# liri-node-app

So I tried multiple times to pull from bands in town, but the API wouldn't work.

I attempted doing a twitter API instead but they need several days to authroize my use :/

Kept getting this error that it could not be found (see images)

I also installed Axios apm but it didn't stick and kept sayign the file path wasn't there. (see images)

Further when I tried the dotenv npm I received a similar error message (see images)

I ended up coding a js file and a key template file but was unable to complete the assginment and am currently utterly confused as to WTF I did wrong.

Had to work this weekend so I didn't have as much time as I'd liek but if someone can go over this with me it would be great.
